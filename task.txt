1) in server, when adding new Blog, add new required field for Category as single
string, Tags may be preserved, but not required.
 In Blog model, add field "categorySlug" for simplify search

2) Category may have a field for count Blogs using it, but
this should be updated on every addBlog or updateBlog.
Too much work on server.. for now why not return record data (category = count) from api? (learning purposes at least)

3) after that, we can finish basic functionality of this client project,
that is, show  blogs by category.

4) add blog count, that is add headers when fetching for blog
5) load head image on post detail



FUTURE ADDITIONS
-share on twitter, facebook, etc buttons
-pass id to detect client (in case of a second blog, choose posts by client)
